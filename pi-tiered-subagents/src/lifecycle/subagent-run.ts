/**
 * subagent-run.ts — One run of a subagent: its outcome, and the handles it holds until it ends.
 *
 * A subagent is a sequence of runs: the initial run, then one per resume. Each
 * run is born with its own abort lever, wires the caller's signal when it
 * starts, and keeps the record observer's unsubscribe until it ends, so nothing
 * a run wires outlives it on the per-agent record.
 *
 * A run exists before it starts: the initial run is born with its agent, and
 * waits in the queue for a concurrency slot as that agent's run.
 *
 * Each run's outcome is its own, so a resume starts a new run rather than
 * resetting the last one, and a carrier holding a run reads what that run
 * ended with whatever ran after it.
